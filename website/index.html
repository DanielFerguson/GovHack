                <h5>The Impacts of Transporting Agriculture </h5>
                <p>
                  Moving over 80 tonnes of agricultural output throughout Australia is expensive, and distance travelled
                  directly impacts the cost of production. Agricultural sources that are closer to point of distribution
                  or consumption entertain a significant economic advantage. These costs also indirectly impact land
                  values, living costs (rural and urban) and lifestyle choices.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h5>Factors</h5>
                <p>
                  There are many factors involved with logistics, such as the health and condition of livestock
                  travelling longer distances to point of sale (POS). Competitiveness of agriculture products decreases
                  with distance from port or POS. Indirect costs include increased fuel costs associated with farm
                  machinery, lifestyle (distance education, domestic shopping) and storage (silos, refrigeration).
                </p>

                <p class="mb-0">
                  Farming is a risky business, when considering the weather. Rain can occur as too much, too little or
                  at the wrong time resulting in reduced agriculture output. Urban demand for water is increasing
                  proportionally as our cities expand, placing pressures on the reticulated infrastructure (Rivers, dams
                  and water storages) and groundwater systems. During times of stress, such as the millennium drought,
                  engineered solutions result in the construction of desalination plants and groundwater bore
                  construction.

                <p>
                  Agriculture is the largest consumer of water, accounting for over 52%, water supply (sewerage,
                  drainage and domestic supply) used 42% and 5% for manufacturing industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the urban population continues to increase, the demand by agriculture industry to supply the needs
                  of urban sprawl will also grow.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This will impact on the designated land use, conservation of wetlands and groundwater systems2.

                <p>
                  Available Water Capacity (AWC) it the water within the soil
                  profile available for plant use. Usually expressed as volume
                  fraction, percentage of a depth. It is a combination of:

                  <ul>
                    <li>Rainfall infiltration (percentage)</li>
                    <li>Soil storage capacity</li>
                  </ul>

                  It ranges from
                  <ul>
                    <li>Field capacity - maximum water retention after saturation and allowed to drain for one or two
                      days</li>
                    <li>Permanent Plant wilting point - plants are no longer able to extract water from the soil
                      resulting in permanent wilting</li>

                <h5>What is Soil pH?</h5>
                <p>
                  The pH (potential hydrogen) is a measure of the acidity or
                  alkalinity with in the soil medium, which includes water, organic
                  matter and mineral content.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>less than 7 is acidic (i.e. orange juice = pH 3)</li>
                  <li>7 is neutral (i.e. pure water = pH 7)</li>
                  <li>greater than 7 is alkaline (i.e. baking soda = pH 9)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Understanding and managing soil pH is important to ensure long
                  term sustainability of agriculture. This helps to maintain soil
                  physical, chemical and biological properties.
                </p>
                <h5>Use in the Index</h5>
                <p>
                  Soil pH affects the soil’s physical, chemical and biological
                  properties and processes, as well as plant growth. The nutrition,
                  growth, and yields of most crops decrease where pH is low and
                  increases as pH rises to an optimum level.

                <p>
                  All soils have salts present that provide some level of electrical conductivity (EC) that is measured
                  in deci-siemens per meter (dS/m) . As levels of soluble salts increase in the soil, the ability of the
                  roots zone of plants to absorb water and nutrients, decreases. Different plants tolerate varying
                  levels of salinity. This tolerance is measured using the ‘saturated extract method’ (ECe) . A
                  conversion factor is used to convert from EC to ECe (see table).

                <h5>Use</h5>
                <p>
                  Low salinity is not necessarily preferable. Some plants (and ecosystems) prefer higher salinity
                  levels!

                  Carbon can be stored in the soil as organic matter, (soil organic carbon-SOC) which is the
                  decomposition of plant and animal matter, and micro-organisms. SOC is the main source of energy for

                  agricultural soils through changes to
                  management may help to mitigate rising greenhouse gas emissions and sustain agricultural productivity

                  SOC affects plant growth as a source of energy, aids mineral uptake for plants, and influences water
                  retention within the soil. Organic acids (e.g., oxalic acid), released during decomposition (such as
                  manures) helps in the availability of phosphorous for plant growth. A reduction in SOC can affect soil
                  stability, water infiltration, drainage and airflow.<small><a

        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p>
          Our project was completed within the time constraints of GovHack. We identified suitable and available
          datasets to include in our land index, but due to time limits, we only chose those datasets which we
          considered to be most important, being soil organic carbon, pH, salinity, distance, average rainfall and
          average soil water capacity. We were unable to obtain metadata on some of the datasets and were unable to
          ascertain if the original data had undergone any transformation. Additionally, the datasets had to be
          converted to raster data, which could affect the accuracy of the final calculated layer. Our team has
          experience related to agricultural, water and soil data, but the algorithm used for the index is not based on
          expert consensus and therefore, it should not be relied on in its current form. All variables derived from
          source datasets were included in the calculation with equal rankings. An improved algorithm needs to be
          developed based on additional research and the consensus of a multi-disciplinary panel of domain experts
          including a determination of the relative ranking that different variables should play, and any additional
          variables needed. The project is limited to the area of Ballarat and surrounds.

        <h5>Future Projects Development</h5>
        <p>
          Innovative Land Index (ILI) has provided a more holistic approach to land valuation and consequentially will
          influence management decisions for the future. Adopting a holistic systems approach must be the future of
          environmental management. This method will help to ensure the sustainable use of resources such as soil
          productivity, water management and environmental protection as urban development continues to expand.

          This project was developed within tight limitations and only shows a glimpse of what would be possible taking
          the concept further and developing it into a decision support tool for agriculture and urban planners. We
          suggest that the following steps should be taken to achieve this. Firstly, a full literature review should be
          conducted to search for prior work in developing models for including agricultural considerations into urban
          planning. Secondly, a multi-disciplinary approach needs to be taken to identify additional data required and
          to develop an algorithm or model which assigns meaningful weights to the different variable. We suggest the
          inclusion of datasets such as slope, wetlands, transport network, processing facilities and groundwater levels
          as a starting point for further development. There is scope for using predicted rainfall to include climate
          change scenarios. We also envisage that the project should be extended to include all of Australia, which
          would necessitate to federate datasets from various state jurisdictions. Widening the scope to include more
          datasets and a larger geographic area would provide a tool for decision making at national level.
