        The Innovative Land Index (ILI) is a proof of concept of how a holistic data-driven approach could be used to
        make better future planning decisions for land zoning. This focuses on providing an index based on soil
        characterstics, rainfall
        and the distance from the major urban centres of farmland and therefore their relative importance to preserve
        into the future.

        <p>
          With increasing populations and urban sprawl there are concerns that prime agricultural land is being
          overtaken by urban development. This poses many problems including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Risks to food security as suitable land for agriculture becomes unavailable forcing agriculture into areas
            that are less ideal.
          </li>
          <li>
            When less ideal land is used for agriculture such as into areas of lower rainfall or poorer soil this
            creates an increased need for irrigation drawing on limited and precious water supplies (groundwater and
            rivers) as well as increased need for fertiliser inputs.
          </li>
          <li>
            We believe that with future urban planning the value of agricultural land would be better considered so
            that locations with the best soils and rainfall are preserved as well as considering the importance of
            reducing food miles and the distance in which the food supply needs to be transported. Likewise this type of
            modelling can be used to identify the best locations for urban developments on current farmland (where
            needed) utilising the least valuable locations for agriculture.

        <h3 class="mb-4 text-center">Method</h3>
        <p>
          The ILI was created using desktop GIS in the open source program QGIS. This index model was created by
          combining various datasets which were determined through our literature research to be important for
          agricultural production, water saving (through the best utilisation of the land areas with the most natural
          rainfall) and the most energy efficient distribution of food (food miles) to urban centres. The land and soil
          attributes included:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Organic Carbon</li>
          <li>Electrical conductivity (as this relates to soil salinity)</li>
          <li>Soil pH (and specifically the variance of soil from the ideal 6.5 pH)</li>
          <li>Available Water Capacity</li>
          <li>Average Annual Rainfall</li>
          <li>Distance to the nearest urban centre</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Normalised raster layers were created for each of these datasets using Inverse Weighted Distance Interpolation
          (IWD). The variables were combined in the final ILI model using the following equation and the raster
          calculator tool in QGIS:
        </p>

        <p>
          <img src="./images/formula.PNG" alt="ILI Formula">
          ILI = Innovative Land Index<br>
          C(n) = Normalised Organic Carbon<br>
          AWC(n) = Normalised Available Water Capacity<br>
          R(n) = Normalised Annual Rainfall<br>
          EC(n) = Normalised Electrical Conductivity<br>
          D(n) = Normalised Distance from Closest Major Urban Centre<br>
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          This equation was used to equally rank all the contributing variables and doing so in a way that adds the
          values of the beneficial qualities of land for agriculture (organic carbon, rainfall and available water
          capacity) and subtracts the values of attributes that are negative with increasing values (distance from
          urban
          centres and electrical conductivity/salinity).
          This produced the ILI raster layer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overlaying this is a simplified version of the Planning Zones Victoria layer. This was created by grouping
          zone categories to the following: Agricultural Zones, Rural Living Zones, Conservation Zones and Built
          Environment Zones (which represent everything else not covered by the other zones and therefore are urban
          areas, housing, industrial buildings etc).
        </p>

          We chose Ballarat and surrounding areas for several reasons.
          Our team is from Ballarat, so we have the advantage of local knowledge. Ballarat is one of the major urban
          areas in Victoria and thus draws on a food from surrounding region, and the area encompasses a diverse range
          of soil types, and current agricultural land uses. Ballarat is also currently forecast as one of the fastest
          growing urban centres in Victoria with increasing urban sprawl into farmland areas.

                <h5>The Impacts of Transporting Agriculture </h5>
                <p>
                  Moving over 80 tonnes of agricultural output throughout Australia is expensive, and distance travelled
                  directly impacts the cost of production. Agricultural sources that are closer to point of distribution
                  or consumption entertain a significant economic advantage. These costs also indirectly impact land
                  values, living costs (rural and urban) and lifestyle choices.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h5>Factors</h5>
                <p>
                  There are many factors involved with logistics, such as the health and condition of livestock
                  travelling longer distances to point of sale (POS). Competitiveness of agriculture products decreases
                  with distance from port or POS. Indirect costs include increased fuel costs associated with farm
                  machinery, lifestyle (distance education, domestic shopping) and storage (silos, refrigeration).
                </p>

                  Farming is a risky business, when considering the weather. Rain can occur as too much, too little or
                  at the wrong time resulting in reduced agriculture output. Urban demand for water is increasing
                  proportionally as our cities expand, placing pressures on the reticulated infrastructure (Rivers, dams
                  and water storages) and groundwater systems. During times of stress, such as the millennium drought,
                  engineered solutions result in the construction of desalination plants and groundwater bore
                  construction.

                  Agriculture is the largest consumer of water, accounting for over 52%, water supply (sewerage,
                  drainage and domestic supply) used 42% and 5% for manufacturing industry.

                  Available Water Capacity (AWC) it the water within the soil
                  profile available for plant use. Usually expressed as volume
                  fraction, percentage of a depth. It is a combination of:

                  It ranges from
                  <ul>
                    <li>Field capacity - maximum water retention after saturation and allowed to drain for one or two
                      days</li>
                    <li>Permanent Plant wilting point - plants are no longer able to extract water from the soil

                <h5>What is Soil pH?</h5>
                <p>
                  The pH (potential hydrogen) is a measure of the acidity or
                  alkalinity with in the soil medium, which includes water, organic
                  matter and mineral content.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>less than 7 is acidic (i.e. orange juice = pH 3)</li>
                  <li>7 is neutral (i.e. pure water = pH 7)</li>
                  <li>greater than 7 is alkaline (i.e. baking soda = pH 9)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Understanding and managing soil pH is important to ensure long
                  term sustainability of agriculture. This helps to maintain soil
                  physical, chemical and biological properties.
                </p>
                <h5>Use in the Index</h5>
                <p>
                  Soil pH affects the soil’s physical, chemical and biological
                  properties and processes, as well as plant growth. The nutrition,
                  growth, and yields of most crops decrease where pH is low and
                  increases as pH rises to an optimum level.

                <p>
                  All soils have salts present that provide some level of electrical conductivity (EC) that is measured
                  in deci-siemens per meter (dS/m) . As levels of soluble salts increase in the soil, the ability of the
                  roots zone of plants to absorb water and nutrients, decreases. Different plants tolerate varying
                  levels of salinity. This tolerance is measured using the ‘saturated extract method’ (ECe) . A
                  conversion factor is used to convert from EC to ECe (see table).

                  Low salinity is not necessarily preferable. Some plants (and ecosystems) prefer higher salinity

                  manures) helps in the availability of phosphorous for plant growth. A reduction in SOC can affect soil
                  stability, water infiltration, drainage and airflow.<small><a

        <h5>FOI - Locality Point - Vicmap Features of Interest</h5>
        <p class="mb-0">
          This dataset was used to locate the offical location of the major urban centres of Ballarat, Geelong, Bendigo
          and Melbourne. Points at these locations were extracted from the dataset and used as 'hubs' for a point
          distance analysis in desktop GIS to the 1km grid over the study area (created for this project) which measured
          the distance of each grid point to the nearest urban centre. This provides the minimum relative 'food mile'
          value for food produced on agricultural land throughout the study area. These distance results were then
          interpolated using inverse distance weighting and included as a variable within the Innovated Land Index
          (ILI).

          This dataset was used to understand landuse at a broad level. The dataset was examined within desktop GIS with
          a subset of the dataset for the project study area. Land zone descriptions were reclassified into the broad
          categories: Agriculture, Rural Living Zone, Conservation and Built Environment (ie everything else). This was
          then overlaid over our Innovating Land Index (ILI) to examine how urban areas and the built environment are

          stage. However future expansion of this project would further use this dataset to look at specific types of
          agricultural crops (eg oilseed crops, vs cereals, vs horticulture) in relation to the land characteristics
          mapped by the Innovative Land Index (ILI) and the specific needs of these land uses.

        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p>
          Our project was completed within the time constraints of GovHack. We identified suitable and available
          datasets to include in our land index, but due to time limits, we only chose those datasets which we
          considered to be most important, being soil organic carbon, pH, salinity, distance, average rainfall and
          average soil water capacity. We were unable to obtain metadata on some of the datasets and were unable to
          ascertain if the original data had undergone any transformation. Additionally, the datasets had to be
          converted to raster data, which could affect the accuracy of the final calculated layer. Our team has
          experience related to agricultural, water and soil data, but the algorithm used for the index is not based on
          expert consensus and therefore, it should not be relied on in its current form. All variables derived from
          source datasets were included in the calculation with equal rankings. An improved algorithm needs to be
          developed based on additional research and the consensus of a multi-disciplinary panel of domain experts
          including a determination of the relative ranking that different variables should play, and any additional
          variables needed. The project is limited to the area of Ballarat and surrounds.

        <h5>Future Projects Development</h5>
        <p>
          Innovative Land Index (ILI) has provided a more holistic approach to land valuation and consequentially will
          influence management decisions for the future. Adopting a holistic systems approach must be the future of
          environmental management. This method will help to ensure the sustainable use of resources such as soil
          productivity, water management and environmental protection as urban development continues to expand.

        <h3 class="text-center">Implications & Future Direction</h3>
        <p>
          This project was developed within tight limitations and only shows a glimpse of what would be possible taking
          the concept further and developing it into a decision support tool for agriculture and urban planners. We
          suggest that the following steps should be taken to achieve this. Firstly, a full literature review should be
          conducted to search for prior work in developing models for including agricultural considerations into urban
          planning. Secondly, a multi-disciplinary approach needs to be taken to identify additional data required and
          to develop an algorithm or model which assigns meaningful weights to the different variable. We suggest the
          inclusion of datasets such as slope, wetlands, transport network, processing facilities and groundwater levels
          as a starting point for further development. There is scope for using predicted rainfall to include climate
          change scenarios. We also envisage that the project should be extended to include all of Australia, which
          would necessitate to federate datasets from various state jurisdictions. Widening the scope to include more
          datasets and a larger geographic area would provide a tool for decision making at national level.
